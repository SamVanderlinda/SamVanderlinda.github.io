            Well it's been a long journey, and I can see the Winter Blues are hitting you hard, but I'm so proud of how your dealing
            with it. I believe you've found a true calling, its incredible how naturally funny you are on stage and 
            the community of people that you found to make yourself feel less lonely than a seniorcitizen. I'm gonna try to never 
            miss any one of your shows. I feel so much pride watching you on stage. It makes me so proud
            to call you my girlfriend. <br /></i>
            <i>I'm sorry that I haven't been around to support you more through this transition. 
            It's been a challenging move out experience, and we should comfort each other when things get tough.
            Today! I look forward to cuddling with you on the couch and marathoning Silicon Valley while dining on Aladdin Fries
            
            I just want to let you know that I love you, and I've been so happy living with just you.
